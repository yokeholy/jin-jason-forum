<h1>About Us</h1>
<p class = "about" style="text-align:left; margin-top:10px"><strong>Jin Wang</strong> is a Senior Computer Science major with a weird combination
of a Music Industry minor at Troy University.  He has worked on several different websites including personal blogs, commercial online shopping systems, 
and on-web games.  Jin is currently struggling to choose between computers and music for his career path. He wants to mix the two but has no clue how.  
The reason to start this project was simple: "It just came into my mind."  After meeting on the very first day of the Web-based Programming course,
Jin invited Jason to develop this forum together.</p>

<p class = "about" style="text-align:left; margin-top:10px"><strong>Jason Campbell</strong> is a Senior Computer Science student at Troy University.  
He has a degree in Computer Engineering from North Carolina State University and has worked in computer hardware design at IBM.  
Back in his home town of Troy, AL, he is seeking a second degree to follow a more software oriented career.
Jason enjoys spending time with his wife and daughter, video games, guitar, tennis, golf, and of course, computer programming!</p><br/><br/>
	
<p class = "about" style="text-align:left; margin-top:10px">Together, <strong>Jin and Jason</strong> decided to put their skills to the test and create 
an open forum to discuss any subject material comprehensive of all human knowledge!</p>
