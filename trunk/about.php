<h1>About Us</h1>
<p class = "about" style="text-align:left; margin-top:10px"><strong>Jin Wang</strong> is a Computer Science major senior student at Troy University with a weird combination of Music Industry minor. He has been working on several different websites by himself from personal blog to commercial online shopping system and on-web game.<br/>
Jin is currently struggling of choosing his career path: computer or music. He wants to mix both but has no clue how to.<br/>
The reason to start this project was simple: "It just came into my mind." Met with Jason on the very first day of the Web-based Programming course, Jin invited him to develop this forum together.</p>
